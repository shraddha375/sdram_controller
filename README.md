# SDRAM Controller

## Why Do You Need an SDRAM Controller?
SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) is widely used in embedded systems, FPGAs, and CPUs due to its high-speed data access capabilities. SDRAM cannot be directly interfaced with most processors, FPGAs, or other digital systems without proper control logic. SDRAM has a complex timing and command sequence that must be carefully managed to ensure correct operation.

## What Is an SDRAM Controller?

An SDRAM Controller is a hardware block that:
- Interfaces between the system (CPU, FPGA, etc.) and the SDRAM.
- Converts simple read/write requests into the detailed command sequences required by the SDRAM.
- Manages all the timing, refresh, and bus control automatically.
